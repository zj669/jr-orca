/**
 * E2E regression test for the Resource Usage popover warm-reattach bug.
 *
 * Why this suite exists:
 *   PR #1667 fixed a bug where workspaces with daemon-backed terminals that
 *   had been running before app launch were rendered as `· REMOTE` with `—`
 *   for CPU/Memory in the Resource Usage popover, even when no SSH targets
 *   were configured. The root cause was that the renderer's `pty-registry`
 *   was empty for warm-reattached sessions until the user clicked into each
 *   pane, so the chip predicate (which keyed on a "snapshot includes this
 *   worktree" flag) misread missing data as "remote." Two changes shipped:
 *   (1) boot-time hydration of `pty-registry` from the daemon, and (2) the
 *   chip predicate switched to `repo.connectionId != null`.
 *
 * What it covers:
 *   - On a second launch against the same userDataDir, the snapshot from
 *     the local memory collector includes the warm-reattached PTY with a
 *     real (non-null) pid before any pane mount in the second renderer.
 *     This is the boot-hydration coverage fix.
 *   - The merged view-model the popover consumes flags the warm worktree
 *     as `isRemote: false` and surfaces numeric CPU/memory.
 *
 * What it does NOT try to cover:
 *   - Multi-worktree warm-reattach. The hydrator iterates all repos ×
 *     worktrees; one is sufficient to lock down the regression path.
 *   - SSH worktrees. Covered by unit tests in `mergeSnapshotAndSessions.test.ts`.
