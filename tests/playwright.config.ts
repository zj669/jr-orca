 * Playwright config for Orca E2E tests.

 * Run:
 *   pnpm run test:e2e              — build + run all tests (headless)
 *   pnpm run test:e2e:headful      — run with visible window (for pointer-capture tests)
 *   SKIP_BUILD=1 pnpm run test:e2e — skip rebuild (faster iteration)
 *
 * globalSetup builds the Electron app and creates a seeded test git repo.
 * globalTeardown cleans up the test repo.
 * Tests use _electron.launch() to start the app — no manual setup needed.
