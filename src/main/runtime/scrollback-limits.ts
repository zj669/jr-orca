// Why: mobile subscribers hydrate the runtime headless emulator from the
// desktop renderer's xterm buffer. The renderer holds a 50k-row scrollback;
// shipping all of it across IPC + replaying through HeadlessEmulator is
// expensive and unnecessary for a phone screen. Cap at 1000 rows and 512 KiB so
// the seed covers a meaningful amount of agent context while keeping the
// round-trip bounded. See docs/mobile-prefer-renderer-scrollback.md.
